Greetings! This github repository serves as a consolidated place for reporting bugs and requesting new features for the video game LOGistICAL: Earth (aka LOGistICAL 3). We have also provided a wiki to answer many frequently asked questions and explain some of the mechanics of the game.

LOGistICAL: Earth, like the rest of the LOGistICAL franchise, was written by sacada and is available on Steam.

The entire LOGistICAL franchise is supported by the active and very friendly Discord community. All players are welcome! <a href="https://discord.gg/xytyWUA"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join-7289DA.svg?logo=discord&longCache=true&style=flat" /></a>

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests:

Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/rayanth/demo-LOGistICAL-issues/issues) tab to browse through all of the reported bugs and suggested new features.

Feel free to comment on any issue! For example, if you have more information that can help reproduce (or work around) a bug, then go ahead and comment on that bug to add the information, we really appreciate it! The same goes for ideas that expand upon somebody's Feature Request that would make it even more awesome!

However, we do ask that comment always be civil, constructive, and add meaningful information. If you merely want to express support (or dislike) for a feature request, or indicate that you have encountered a bug as well, then use the "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" emoticons.

## LOGistICAL: Earth, the Wiki:

The [Wiki](https://github.com/rayanth/demo-LOGistICAL-issues/wiki) was written to consolidate information on the game mechanics and features in one easy-to-use location. The intent is to provide a "game manual" to help new and old players alike understand the game better, and have one central resource to direct others to when they ask questions.
